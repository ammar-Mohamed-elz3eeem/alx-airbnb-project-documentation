This document outlines the requirements for the AirBnB Clone project.

## User Requirements

### 1. User Authentication System

#### Functional Requirements

##### Registration

- Allow users to register as either a guest or a host by providing:
  - Full Name

- Validate email format and password strength during registration.
- Send a confirmation email after successful registration.

##### Login

- Enable users to log in using:
  - Email and password combination.
  - OAuth options for social login (e.g., Google, Facebook).

##### Authentication

- Use JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for managing user sessions.

##### Forgot Password

- Sends a password reset link via email.
- Validates the token and expiration time for password resets.

#### Technical Requirements

- Authentication service built using Python Django framework.
- Secure password hashing using bcrypt.
- Implement role-based access control (RBAC) to restrict actions by user type.
- Configure OAuth providers (Google, Facebook) using Authlib.

#### Non-Functional Requirements

- Ensure login APIs respond within 200ms under normal load.
- Log all failed login attempts and lock accounts temporarily after 5 failed attempts.
- Encrypt all sensitive user data before storage.

### 2. Property Management System

##### Add Listings

- Hosts can add property details, including:

##### Technical Requirements

- Use a relational database (e.g., PostgreSQL) to store property data.
- Implement file upload and storage for property images using AWS S3 or Cloudinary.
- Validate property details (e.g., price must be positive, availability dates must be valid).

##### Non-Functional Requirements

- Optimize database queries for search and filter operations.
- Handle up to 10,000 property listings with minimal performance degradation.

### 3. Booking Management System

#### Functional Requirements

##### Booking Creation:
